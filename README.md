Online Retail Market Basket Analysis

This project applies Market Basket Analysis on the Online Retail dataset using the Apriori algorithm to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules. The focus is on the top 3 customer regions (countries), with detailed analysis of their transaction patterns, cross-selling opportunities, and business implications.

The project is divided into two main parts. Market Basket Analysis done by data understanding through cleaning, transformation, handling missing values, and exploratory analysis, followed by splitting the data according to country to create region-based baskets. The Apriori algorithm is then applied on the top three baskets to generate frequent itemsets and association rules. Business Value Analysis focuses on interpreting the most important rules for each basket and summarizing their implications in terms of product bundling, cross-selling opportunities, and customer behavior insights.

Frequent itemsets and association rules were extracted for the UK, Germany, and France, the top three regions by transaction volume. The rules revealed common co-purchases and seasonal demand patterns, offering opportunities for targeted marketing and promotions. The UK basket, as the core market with high retail activity, showed strong associations between popular gift items, indicating significant cross-selling potential. The Germany basket reflected a higher concentration of wholesalers, suggesting that bundling strategies could effectively drive bulk sales. The France basket displayed more diverse purchasing behavior, highlighting opportunities for personalized recommendations and regional promotions. Overall, the association rules provide actionable insights to support cross-selling, inventory management, and region-specific marketing strategies.
